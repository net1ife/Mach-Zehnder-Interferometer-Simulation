# Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Simulation

This program simulates the behavior of a quantum optical system, specifically a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, using the Strawberry Fields quantum computing library.

## Description

The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer is a classic device in quantum optics that demonstrates the principle of quantum interference. This program allows you to explore the effects of various phase settings and input states on the behavior of a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer.

## Features

* Choose the phase settings for the two phase shifters in the interferometer from a set of common values.
* Choose the type of input state (either a single photon state or a coherent state).
* The program will run the quantum simulation and print the most probable photon number for each output mode of the interferometer.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to choose the phase settings for the two phase shifters.
3. Choose the type of input state (either a single photon state or a coherent state).
4. The program will display the most probable photon number for each output mode.

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* Strawberry Fields
* NumPy

## Installation

You can install Strawberry Fields and NumPy via pip:

```
pip install strawberryfields numpy
```
